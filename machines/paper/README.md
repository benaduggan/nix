# Bootstrapping

I didn't really do a good job of keeping track of what I did here, but I did follow this video

as well as these files (heavily modified in this repo)

# Daily use

Now I should be able to just edit the files within this directory

To update the system, run

```
darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/cfg/machines/paper/
```
